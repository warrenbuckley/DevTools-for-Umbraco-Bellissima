### Browser Extension Stores
Will be republished soon

## Developing
* Run `npm install` in the terminal at the root of this repository
* Run `npm run build` or `npm run watch` to have the typescript files in the `src` folder built or watched for changes
    * The typescript files are built and placed into the folder called `extension` which the browser extension will load from
    * rollup.js is used to compile the typescript files along with bundle any npm node_modules that are used such as Lit for WebComponent development
* Run `npm run start:firefox` to have FireFox open with the extension loaded and monitoring any changes to the files in the `extension` folder
* Run `npm run start:chromium` to have Chrome or chromium based browser open with the extension loaded and monitoring any changes to the files in the `extension` folder
